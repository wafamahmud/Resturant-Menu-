            Red Curry. The authentic Thai red curry is a happy medium between the yellow and green curry options, it is spicier than yellow curry but not as hot as green curry. The stunning red colour of this curry comes from the crushed red chillies which makes up the paste, which also includes garlic and shallots, lemongrass and blue ginger. Made with chicken breast, the paste is added to coconut milk and vegetables like tomatoes, mushrooms and eggplant.
